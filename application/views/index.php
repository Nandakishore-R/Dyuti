    Background
  </b><br>
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) underscore the pivotal
role of the social work profession in fostering collaboration with
diverse professions and partners, thereby enriching a comprehensive,
interdisciplinary, and multisectoral approach to service delivery. With
a steadfast commitment to enhancing both social and economic
well-being at various strata of society, the SDGs seamlessly align
with the profession’s mission to advance the welfare of individuals,
families, organizations, and communities. Social work professionals
actively engage with specific focus groups specified within the SDGs,
including women, children, youth, individuals with disabilities, older
adults, indigenous communities, internally displaced populations,
migrants, and refugees. The global mandate of the SDGs presents
social work professionals with a unique opportunity to redefine their
role, championing human rights and social justice for these target
populations, and contributing significantly to the global pursuit of
these vital objectives.<br><br>

  25 years of Internationalisation @ Rajagiri

</div>
  <p>
    'Internationalisation' has been a catchword for Rajagiri since its inception and we have completed
    25 years of official International collaborations. Currently, Rajagiri
    has official agreements with 60+ International Universities across 30 countries.
     Establishing vibrant academic tie-ups with leading universities all over the world
      has not only helped the students to get international exposure, but also facilitated
       in sharing of resources for faculty training, curriculum development, research, and
        consultancy. Our students from PG and UG programmes regularly do short-term study
         programmes in our Partner Universities with a duration ranging from 1 month to 6 months.
          We host International students in our regular programmes as full-time students which
           is also supported by the Study in India (SII) Programme from the Govt of India. The
            various programmes offered by Rajagiri also have twinning, dual degree arrangements
